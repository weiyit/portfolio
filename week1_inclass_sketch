#### In-class sketching exercise
- Description: This visualization presents a comparison of the level of focus on school work, job searching, or leisure activities during weekdays and weekends.
- Reason for Choosing this Visualization: I opted for this visualization because it employs two bars, making it simple to discern the differences between weekdays and weekends.
- Choice of Colors: Red indicates the most focused periods as it imparts a sense of intensity, while yellow, being softer and warmer, conveys relaxation, and orange is between the two.
- Additional Elements: I have incorporated three distinct shapes to clarify the activities during different time intervals.

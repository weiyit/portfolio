# Assignment 3 & 4: Critique by Design

### Step one: find a data visualization (with data you can use!)

**Data Visualization**
- Data visualization source: CATO Institute
- Data visualization source topic: Are Mass Shootings Becoming More Frequent?

**Data**
- Data source: Mother Jones
- Data source topic: US Mass Shootings, 1982–2023: Data From Mother Jones’ Investigation
- Data source link: https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/12/mass-shootings-mother-jones-full-data/


### Step two: critique the data visualization

** Describe your overall observations about the data visualization here.  What stood out to you?  What did you find worked really well?  What didn't?  What, if anything, would you do differently? **

In this visualization, there are aspects that work effectively. Firstly, it effectively conveys the increasing trend of mass shootings over the years, which is clear and straightforward. Secondly, the chart strategically places labels on certain peaks, drawing viewers' attention to those specific points. Through this emphasis, we can discern trends. However, the chart has room for improvement in two areas. Firstly, since the scale of the number of incidents differs from that of the number of fatalities, it becomes challenging to gauge the magnitude of the increase when both are presented together. It appears as a slight increase, but quantifying it precisely is challenging. I would propose altering the presentation of the incidents and adjusting the color scheme to enhance focus. Additionally, I'd consider providing more detailed information to empower our audience to extract meaningful insights and take informed actions.

** Who is the primary audience for this tool?  Do you think this visualization is effective for reaching that audience?  Why or why not? **

The primary audience for this visualization would be individuals residing in the United States or those considering relocating to the country, seeking insights into the severity of mass shooting incidents over the past few years. Through this visualization, we can readily discern the concerning trend of increasing fatalities occurring approximately every 5 to 8 years. Another potential audience could be government safety department officials, who are interested in understanding the situation and identifying potential areas for improvement. However, for both target groups, the visualization may fall short in providing actionable information.

** Final thoughts: how successful what this method at evaluating the data visualization you selected? Are there measures you feel are missing or not being captured here?  What would you change?  Provide 1-2 recommendations (color, type of visualization, layout, etc.) **

The evaluation method could be enhanced by taking into account the context in which the visualization will be employed. It's crucial to grasp the particular objectives and inquiries the visualization is designed to tackle, as this can guide the refinement of evaluation criteria. As previously mentioned, it's not only about delivering information to the audience but also assisting them in reaching decisions or drawing conclusions. Striking the right balance is key, as an overload of information on the graph can lead to reduced focus, while too little information can render it ineffective.

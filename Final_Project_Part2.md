# Project Outline

This project aims to construct a compelling narrative that delves into the critical issue of suicide prevention. With suicide rates on the rise, this has become a severe societal problem. It's not just about the sadness for families; it incurs economic and social costs, increases healthcare expenses, and contributes to depression in communities.

The project will present statistical evidence, highlighting the alarming suicide rates in the chosen region or country and by demographic categories. Ultimately, the project seeks to persuade policymakers to allocate budget resources to suicide prevention efforts and also enhance the awareness of how important mental health is. It underscores the potential for meaningful change and a brighter future for all.

## Target audience

This story is designed to speak directly to two main groups: policymakers and everyone in our communities. For the policymakers, the focus will be on providing clear facts and stories about the rising suicide rates, showing them the real impact on different people's lives and on the society. The goal is to convince them that investing in suicide prevention is crucial and can make a big difference.

I am going to randomly pick anyone I meet in Heinz and ask them about my story design,.

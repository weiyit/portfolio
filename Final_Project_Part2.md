# Wireframes / storyboards
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project.

# User research 

## Target audience

This story is designed to speak directly to two main groups: policymakers and everyone in our communities. For the policymakers, the focus will be on providing clear facts and stories about the rising suicide rates, showing them the real impact on different people's lives and on the society. The goal is to convince them that investing in suicide prevention is crucial and can make a big difference.

I am going to randomly pick anyone I meet in Heinz and ask them about my story design,.

Step 4: I kind of like this plot, to make the plot more clear and easy to read, please adjust the colors as follows: Use a darker blue for the top-ranked country with paid public holidays, pink for the top-ranked country with paid leave days, and for the remaining countries, use varying shades of light grey-blue and light pink.

Step 5: Great, please increase the font size for both the title and the labels to make them more prominent and easier to read. Please add a threshold line which shows the total average days.

### Part 3

I chose to use a violin plot for this analysis as it is particularly effective in visualizing the distribution of data when you have a categorical variable and want to understand how a variable is distributed within each category. In the government debt dataset, I used the violin plot to visualize the distribution of Debt-to-GDP Ratios in each country over different years.

To conduct this analysis, I collected data from 2000 to 2022 and included only those countries that had data available for every year within this time frame, resulting in 23 data points. It's worth noting that a debt-to-GDP ratio below 60% is generally considered manageable for many developed countries, while ratios above this threshold may raise concerns about sustainability.

For instance, when examining the results, we can observe that the Czech Republic has consistently maintained a low debt-to-GDP ratio over the past 23 years. In contrast, Japan exhibits a much wider distribution of debt-to-GDP ratios over the same period, with consistently higher values. This indicates that Japan has faced challenges in managing its debt relative to the Czech Republic.

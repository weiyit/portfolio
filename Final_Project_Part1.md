# Outline
This project aims to construct a compelling narrative that delves into the critical issue of suicide prevention. With suicide rates on the rise, this has become a severe societal problem. It's not just about the sadness for families; it incurs economic and social costs, increases healthcare expenses, and contributes to depression in communities.

The project will present statistical evidence, highlighting the alarming suicide rates in the chosen region or country and by demographic categories. Ultimately, the project seeks to persuade policymakers to allocate budget resources to suicide prevention efforts and also enhance the awareness of how important mental health is. It underscores the potential for meaningful change and a brighter future for all.

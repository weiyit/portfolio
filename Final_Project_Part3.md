# A final writeup for Part III on a new Github page that summarizes all the work you've done thus far to create your final project.  

After completing Part II of my project, I took into consideration the valuable feedback gathered from interviews with various individuals, including students from Heinz and my girl friends. Their insights helped me make significant improvements to my data story, especially in terms of clarity, emotional impact, and actionable content.

Firstly, based on the feedback received, I recognized the need to provide specific context for the statistics presented. Adding the location and year for the suicide rates addressed this concern. This adjustment ensured that the audience could easily understand the scope of the issue without additional explanation, enhancing the overall clarity of the narrative.

Additionally, I decided to modify the color scheme of the visuals in my data story. The feedback about inconsistency in colors was crucial. By aligning the colors of the bottom photos with those used in the introduction, I aimed to maintain a consistent visual tone throughout the entire story. Consistency in design elements contributes significantly to the overall aesthetic appeal and readability of the story.

To address the need for more detailed information, I expanded the text within the story. This allowed me to strike a balance between providing in-depth information for those interested in a deeper understanding of the issue and ensuring that the main message was clear and concise for those with limited time. By enriching the content, I ensured that the story catered to both audiences effectively.

Moreover, I incorporated specific actions at the end of the story. This addition was a direct response to the interviewees' feedback regarding the need for actionable takeaways. By clearly outlining the steps that can be taken, such as allocating budgets and implementing prevention programs, I aimed to provoke discussions and inspire tangible actions among policymakers and readers.

Another important enhancement was the addition of data points for the line chart. This adjustment aimed to provide a more granular view of the statistics, making it easier for the audience to grasp the magnitude of the issue. Visualizations play a significant role in conveying complex data, and the inclusion of data points ensured that the audience could engage with the information more effectively.

Reflecting on the design decisions made along the way, I learned the importance of balancing creativity with clarity. While creative visualizations, such as the clock and graph, captured attention and enhanced the story's appeal, they needed to be intuitive and easily understandable. Striking this balance was key to ensuring that the audience remained engaged while comprehending the gravity of the issue presented.

In conclusion, the feedback and iterative adjustments made in response to the interviews played a pivotal role in refining my data story. By incorporating location and year details, maintaining consistent visuals, enriching the content, providing actionable insights, and improving data visualization, I was able to create a compelling narrative that effectively resonated with my target audience – policymakers – thereby enhancing the impact of my suicide prevention advocacy. This experience reinforced the significance of user feedback in the storytelling process, emphasizing the importance of aligning the narrative with the audience's needs and expectations.

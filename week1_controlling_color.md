#### Controlling Color - The Simple Pie Exercise
In my approach, I've focused on highlighting the contrast in interest between two distinct age groups: those over 30 and those under 30. To make this comparison clearer, I used a darker color for the categories 'very interested' and 'somewhat interested' in both age groups. This choice of color was intended to draw immediate attention to the key differences in drone-buying interest between these demographics.

Additionally, I've added labels with increased font size, providing clearer context to the reader. This makes it easier to see and read the exact percentages or numbers behind each category, facilitating a more precise comparison.

As I consider alternative visualization methods, I'm thinking whether a bar plot might be more effective. Bar plots can make it easier to compare two categories directly. For instance, using a bar plot, we can clearly see that the percentage of individuals over 30 who are 'very interested' and 'somewhat interested' in buying drones is lower than half of the corresponding percentages in the under-30 age group.

## Narrative structure

#### Setup

Initially, the discussion draws upon various countries, such as Poland, Israel, and Korea, to highlight the undeniable wage disparity between women and men. This gap is a well-documented fact.
Furthermore, the video emphasizes a significant point. It underscores that when one visits a grocery store, there is no concept of a 'woman discount.' Instead, everyone is expected to pay the same prices. This particular point invites readers to consider the notion that perhaps women should not necessarily have lower prices, raising questions about equity and fairness.

#### Conflict

Many people perceive the unequal pay between women and men as discrimination. However, research results often reveal that it's not about discrimination but deeply rooted in cultural and societal expectations regarding gender roles
One of the primary reasons for the wage gap was that, in the 1980s, women generally had lower levels of education, often engaged in repetitive or traditionally feminine jobs.
As society evolved, the pay gap began to narrow because educational and other factors became more equal between genders.
The significant remaining factor is the expectation that women should bear and raise children. This is a societal expectation that continues to impact the wage gap.
In the video, it uses animation to show the changing pay gap between men and women under the trade-off between work and family.

Then it employs a dynamic line chart to illustrate that the critical determinant of income disparity is not gender but rather whether an individual has children
Societal expectations play a significant role. Many women feel obliged or desire to prioritize childcare, even at the cost of missing out on career opportunities. 
For women without children, there is still potential for a substantial increase in their income.

#### Resolution

The video provides an example: when individuals get promoted and consider how to decorate their workplace, a significant difference emerges based on their gender. If it's a man who adorns his office with numerous family photos, colleagues often commend his ability to provide for his family. However, if it's a woman, she might face judgments about her commitment to her job. This example vividly highlights the enduring influence of societal expectations and gender stereotypes in people's minds.
The video presents two countries as examples of how the gender pay gap can be effectively narrowed, emphasizing the feasibility of achieving such progress.
Emphasize and isolate

The video employs data to clarify that unequal pay isn't primarily due to discrimination, but rather stems from societal expectations. It's powerful.

## Lure

In the beginning, the video addresses the widely discussed concept of equal pay for equal work, a belief held by many. However, as the narrative unfolds, readers gain a clearer understanding of the disparities between these expectations and the actual reality.

About me
Under the About me section, write a couple paragraphs about yourself!  You can include things like your name, pronouns, the program you're in, or other insights you'd like to share with the class (and more broadly, perhaps future employers!).  You don't have to include any personal information here that you would prefer keeping off of a public website (see the note below). 

Hello everyon! I am Judy Tsai, a Master's student in Healthcare Analytics & Information technology Program.


What I hope to learn
Under the What I hope to learn section, talk about what you're interested in getting out of the course and what you are planning to do once you graduate.  You can include other information you think is helpful to the rest of the class, including a photo if you like - follow the Github markdown guide to learn how.

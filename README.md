# **About me**
Hello everyone! I'm Judy Tsai, currently in my second year of the Healthcare Analytics & Information Technology program at Carnegie Mellon University. My expertise lies in data science, digital transformation, and information systems, and I have a strong passion for leveraging data and information technology to provide innovative solutions for companies and make a meaningful impact. I am set to graduate in May 2024 and am planning to secure a job in the United States.

# **What I hope to learn**
In my pursuit of roles centered around data science, digital transformation, and information technology, I understand the importance of being a good communicator. To succeed in these positions, you need to explain your ideas well and get others on board with them.

These roles often involve making big changes, and change can be hard for people to accept, it's important to get better at persuading others by showing them data and telling stories. However, changing how people think can be tough. People usually like to stick to their usual habits and thoughts, so it can be challenging to convince them to do something new. But I believe that the skills I'll learn in this course will help me with my career by making it easier to convince others and bring about positive changes.

#### In-class sketching exercise
- Description: This visualization presents a comparison of the level of focus on school work, job searching, or leisure activities during weekdays and weekends.
- Reason for Choosing this Visualization: I opted for this visualization because it employs two bars, making it simple to discern the differences between weekdays and weekends.
- Choice of Colors: Red indicates the most focused periods as it imparts a sense of intensity, while yellow, being softer and warmer, conveys relaxation, and orange is between the two.
- Additional Elements: I have incorporated three distinct shapes to clarify the activities during different time intervals.

#### Controlling Color - The Simple Pie Exercise
In my approach, I've focused on highlighting the contrast in interest between two distinct age groups: those over 30 and those under 30. To make this comparison clearer, I used a darker color for the categories 'very interested' and 'somewhat interested' in both age groups. This choice of color was intended to draw immediate attention to the key differences in drone-buying interest between these demographics.

Additionally, I've added labels with increased font size, providing clearer context to the reader. This makes it easier to see and read the exact percentages or numbers behind each category, facilitating a more precise comparison.

As I consider alternative visualization methods, I'm thinking whether a bar plot might be more effective. Bar plots can make it easier to compare two categories directly. For instance, using a bar plot, we can clearly see that the percentage of individuals over 30 who are 'very interested' and 'somewhat interested' in buying drones is lower than half of the corresponding percentages in the under-30 age group.

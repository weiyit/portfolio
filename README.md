# Judy Tsai Porfolio

## About me
Hello everyon! I am Judy Tsai, a second year Master's student in Healthcare Analytics & Information technology Program.
I am interested in data science, digital transformation, and change management, aiming to get a job in the States after I graduate.

## What I hope to learn
I am planning to find a job focusing on data science, digital transformation, and change management. In these positions, I would say it is really important for these roles to have a good communication skill and have the ability to convince people for the project. All of the projec tthat these roles might work on is all about changing, and change always invlove disagreement. Addtionally, it is hard to change people mindset. When they get used to do something, or there is a typical way they used to, it's difficult to change them. Therefore, a good design and good story telling skills can help me to have a better approach.

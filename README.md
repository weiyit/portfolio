# **About me**
Hello everyone! I'm Judy Tsai, currently in my second year of the Healthcare Analytics & Information Technology program at Carnegie Mellon University. My expertise lies in data science, digital transformation, and information systems, and I have a strong passion for leveraging data and information technology to provide innovative solutions for companies and make a meaningful impact. I am set to graduate in May 2024 and am planning to secure a job in the United States.

# **What I hope to learn**
In my pursuit of roles centered around data science, digital transformation, and information technology, I understand the importance of being a good communicator. To succeed in these positions, you need to explain your ideas well and get others on board with them.

These roles often involve making big changes, and change can be hard for people to accept, it's important to get better at persuading others by showing them data and telling stories. However, changing how people think can be tough. People usually like to stick to their usual habits and thoughts, so it can be challenging to convince them to do something new. But I believe that the skills I'll learn in this course will help me with my career by making it easier to convince others and bring about positive changes.

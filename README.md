# Judy Tsai Porfolio

## About me
Hello everyone! I'm Judy Tsai, a second-year Master's student in the Healthcare Analytics & Information Technology program. My passion lies in the fields of data science, digital transformation, and change management, and I'm setting my sights on securing a job in the United States upon graduation.

## What I hope to learn
In my pursuit of roles centered around data science, digital transformation, and change management, I recognize the importance of effective communication skills. The success of these positions often rely on the ability to articulate ideas persuasively and gain buy-in from others. Since these roles always involve change, and change can frequently spark resistance, I see the necessity of improving my skills in convincing others by visualizing data and telling stories.

Furthermore, reshaping other people's mindsets can be a challenge. People tend to stick to familiar routines or thoughts, making it tough to change. To overcome this obstacle, I believe that the skills that I will gain in this course will be useful for my career.

## Project

### Week 1

**#### In-class sketching exercise**

- Description: This visualization presents a comparison of the level of focus on school work, job searching, or leisure activities during weekdays and weekends.
- Reason for Choosing this Visualization: I opted for this visualization because it employs two bars, making it simple to discern the differences between weekdays and weekends.
- Choice of Colors: Red indicates the most focused periods as it imparts a sense of intensity, while yellow, being softer and warmer, conveys relaxation, and orange is between the two.
- Additional Elements: I have incorporated three distinct shapes to clarify the activities during different time intervals.

**#### Controlling Color - week one sketching exercise**

The Simple Pie Exercise

In my approach, I've focused on highlighting the contrast in interest between two distinct age groups: those over 30 and those under 30. To make this comparison clearer, I used a darker color for the categories 'very interested' and 'somewhat interested' in both age groups. This choice of color was intended to draw immediate attention to the key differences in drone-buying interest between these demographics.

Additionally, I've added labels with increased font size, providing clearer context to the reader. This makes it easier to see and read the exact percentages or numbers behind each category, facilitating a more precise comparison.

As I consider alternative visualization methods, I'm thinking whether a bar plot might be more effective. Bar plots can make it easier to compare two categories directly. For instance, using a bar plot, we can clearly see that the percentage of individuals over 30 who are 'very interested' and 'somewhat interested' in buying drones is lower than half of the corresponding percentages in the under-30 age group.
